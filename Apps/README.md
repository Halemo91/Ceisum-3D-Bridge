4. How To
----------

The 3D objects can be generated by using the following tool chain: 

1. [Importer-Exporter](https://github.com/virtualcitySYSTEMS/importer-exporter) to export COLLADA files from a [3DCityDB](www.3dcitydb.net) incl. an additional JSON document which contains information about the tile structure
2. [colladaToBglTFConverter](https://github.com/virtualcitySYSTEMS/colladaToBglTFConverter) to convert the COLLADA files to binary glTF

Have a look at this [demo](http://hosting.virtualcitysystems.de/demos/berlin/cesium/) which is based on this tool chain.
